# Remittance
This repo stores the small project of the same name from the B9Labs ethereum development course. It was developed using Ganache from the Truffle suite, which will by default generate accounts with enough ether in them to make the tests work. `truffle.js` is also configured to point to a default Ganache installation.

The tests will work the first time around, but will not work a second time, as fixed password hashes are used.
